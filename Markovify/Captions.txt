I’m not high maintenance, you’re just low effort
I’m not gonna sugar coat the truth, I’m not Willy Wonka
Life is better when you’re laughing
Look for the magic in every moment
Vodka may not be the answer, but it’s worth a shot
A sass a day keeps the basics away
Me, myself, and I
Just me
But first, let me take a selfie
Typical me
Selfie Sunday
I was born to shine
Me doing me
I don’t always take a selfie, but when I do…
What do you think of this look?
I woke up like this
Couldn’t be happier.
You can regret a lot of things, but you’ll never regret being kind
Do whatever makes you happiest

Friends are like stars, constantly coming and going, but the ones that stay burn as bright as the sun
A good friend might know your wild stories but your best friend was right there with you
I would never let my best friend do anything stupid … alone
bff 
Laughing at random things. Partying ‘til the sunrise. There’s no one else I’d want by my side. Love ya!
Hold onto your best friend because you’ll never find someone like them again
Back in the old days my best friend was quiet and shy. I turned her into a monster. 
Find someone who brings out the best in you
A best friend is like your favorite bra: supportive, comfortable, hard to find, and close to your heart
A best friend will love you when you’re too sad to love yourself
Yes or No?

Everyone has a chapter they don’t read out loud

Surprise!
Awkward …
Act like you own the world, because you do
As long as my bank account keeps growing, I couldn’t care less about anything else
I keep it real because I’m not afraid of having enemies
… um ok
You were my cup of tea, but I drink wine now
Ambition on fleek
I wouldn’t chase you because I’m the catch
Know your worth but don’t forget to add tax
I’m the reason why I smile everyday

Grocery shopping today with Hooooman 
Whisker Wednesday. So nice outside today.
Happy #Caturday y’all
Happiness comes in waves.
Sun of a beach!
Good times and tan lines.
Life is better with the sand between your toes
Nama’stay at the beach.
Sorry, out on a beach relaxing. Be back soon!
I love you to the sand bar and back.
Passports and palm trees
BEACH: Best Escape Anyone Can Have
“If you think adventure is dangerous; try routine. It’s lethal.” —Paulo Coelho
Go to the place where you feel most alive
A walk in the woods feels like home
By getting lost in nature, you get closer to finding yourself
If you’re looking for heaven on earth step outside
Sometimes all the soul needs is a walk in nature
The mountains call to me
“If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need” — Marcus Tullius Cicero
If you’re looking for beauty, you’ll find it in nature
Life is short and the world is wide so get out there and explore it
Wherever you go, leave a trail
An apple a day will keep anyone away if you throw it hard enough
Give second chances but not for the same mistake
Never sacrifice three things: family, love, and/or yourself
I’m an original and that’s perfection in itself
You can’t dull my sparkle ✨
Be the person you needed when you were young
Life is about taking chances and having fun
So grateful for this moment
I’m thankful for the struggles that made me the person I am today
Life is the biggest party you’ll ever be at
Messy bun and having fun
I got it from my mama
A great girl is classy not trashy
Girls are changing the world
Who run the world? GIRLS.
Just like my eyeliner, I always wing it
I’m not one in a million, I’m one in 7 billion
Leave a little sparkle everywhere you go
I’m wild and free
The only person I dress to impress is me
Boys will be boys
Chillin’ with my bros
Boys got swagger, men have style, but gentlemen have class
A great man is strong because he can be gentle
Haters are my greatest motivators
A real man provides, protects and perseveres
The only time a man should ever lie is to surprise someone
No guts, no glory
Release the beast within
Be a warrior in a room of worriers
Good food, good mood
I’m on a seafood diet. I see food I eat it.
Never settle for just one scoop
Don’t be upsetti, eat some spaghetti
Chocolate is cheaper than therapy
Waffles are just pancakes with abs
Food before dudes
When you’re downie eat a brownie
Pasta la vista baby
You can’t live a full life on an empty stomach
Resting coffee face
Hocus pocus I need coffee to focus
Life is better with a coffee in hand
I like big cups and I cannot lie
Taking a little coffee break
Feeling depresso without my espresso
I like myself how I like my coffee: dark, bitter, and too hot for you
Caffeine Queen
Too much Monday, not enough coffee
When things go wrong, coffee helps
Oh hey there!
Short and sweet
…
I got nothing
Insert witty Instagram caption here
Just livin’ life
Just chillin’
Today’s perfect
Yup, another food pic
Why so serious?
Time for a change
Today's a good day to have a good day
Happiness is a choice
Smile big, laugh often
Find your happy place and live in it
This is my happy place
Happiness looks good on you
Keep shining
Happiness is contagious
Surround yourself with things and people that make you smile
Let your smile be your signature accessory
Choose joy, spread love, and be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Every day is a new chance to find happiness
Capture the moments that make your heart smile
Find joy in the little things; they add up to a beautiful life
Happiness is not about having everything, but appreciating what you have
Waking up with a grateful heart and a happy soul
Embrace the happiness within you
Tears come straight from the heart
Sometimes, at night, I hope to fall asleep before I fall apart
I didn’t change. You did. You stopped loving me.
“Learning is a gift. Even if pain is the teacher.” —Maya Watson
As a kid I was afraid of monsters under my bed, but as I grow older I realize they live inside my head.
Want to be happy? Care less.
Until you’ve heard my story, you have no idea
Even when I’m sad, I show off my big smile anyways
I miss you …
The rumor is true, I’m sad. Again.
I’d rather be someone’s Sunday morning, not Saturday night
Be the EXTRA in extraordinary
I don’t believe in SOMEDAY, I believe in TODAY
When life gives me lemons, I make lemonade then sell it
My life my rules
I’m not lucky, I’m talented
You can beat me down but I’ll just jump back up
I may be down to earth but I’m still above you
I’m confident, your opinion of me won’t change that
I’ve got hustle and heart
Attitude on fleek
I'm the queen/king of my own attitude
My attitude is a reflection of my awesomeness
I don't have an attitude problem; I have a personality you can't handle
Unapologetically me
I'm not anti-social, I'm selectively social
I'm not here to fit in. I'm here to stand out
My attitude is a mix of confidence and sass
I'm the architect of my own attitude
Confidence is my best accessory
Hate me or love me, either way, I'm still on your mind
I'm not a second option; I'm a priority or nothing at all
Attitude is everything; it's the lens through which I see the world
I may not be perfect, but my attitude is impeccable
I'm not trying to be everyone's cup of tea. I'm my own double-shot espresso
I'm not chasing anyone; I'm too busy chasing my dreams
My attitude is the weapon that takes me places
Don’t be average, be savage
It’s not my fault truth hurts, here’s a Band-Aid
Be the kind of person that makes others step up their game
Single as a dollar but not looking for change
Well-behaved people don’t make it into history books
Looks aren’t everything but I have them just in case
People say I act like I don’t care but it’s not an act
I can easily tell how intelligent someone is by how stupid they think I am
I’m classy, sassy, and a bit badassy
I’ve got my sassy pants on. Watch out world!
I’m too glam to give a damn
Too glam to give a damn
Confidence level: Selfie with no filter
I'm not bossy, I just have better ideas
I'm not a backup plan — I'm a first choice
I'm not here for your approval. I'm here to slay
If you're waiting for me to care, you better bring a comfortable chair
In a world full of trends, I want to remain a classic
I'm too busy loving my life to worry about yours
Life's too short to wear boring clothes
I'm not rude, I just say what everyone else is thinking
I don't chase dreams, I hunt goals
I'm not sugarcoating anything. I'm the whole bakery
Who let the dogs out?
You are pawfection
My dog is the only friend I need
Sorry can’t hangout, my dog and I have plans
Be the kind of person your dog thinks you are
My dog thinks I’m kind of a big deal
I’d rather be at home with my dog
I have the best dog
As long as you have your dog’s love, you have everything
Hush puppy
Proud cat lady
She’s purrfect
You’ll never regret time spent with your cat
Home is where my cat is
You had me at meow
Life is better with cats
Owning a cat is like eating M&M’s—you can’t have just one
Fur real though
I litter-ally can’t live without my cat
I’ve been feline good today

“I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't bore you.” —David Bowie
Here’s to all the fun memories, late nights, and cups of coffee that got me here
It’s time to pursue my purpose
BRB. Working on my dreams.
When I feel like giving up on my dreams, I keep sleeping
The best workout is a cross between a lunge and a crunch. Lunch.
If I was funny, I’d have a better Instagram caption for this
insert funny Instagram caption here
This is my pretty hungry face
Putting the “we” in weird
We’re all born a little crazy, some of us just choose to stay that way
We all have that one friend …
I don’t know what’s tighter: my jeans or our love
Mirror: you look amazing today. Camera: Nope, you don’t.
I’m a model … Well … an Instagram model. Same thing right?
But first, let me take 40 selfies until choosing one that actually works
Namast’ay in bed
You’re like a four-leaf clover: hard to find and lucky to have
You’re amazing, brave, strong, beautiful, and perfect in every way
So much to be thankful for
Nothing shines brighter than a heart of gold
Mistakes are proof that you’ve tried
The journey is always the best part
Today’s the best kind of day
Life is only as legendary as you make it
Good vibes only
Living the good life
Don’t judge someone by their mistakes but on how they fix them
If I don’t post a picture, did it even really happen?
They call me ranch ’cuz I be dressing
One does not simply create a clever Instagram caption
Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s the Clarendon filter
If the world was created in 7 days but it took 9 months to make me, I’m clearly a big deal
People will judge everything you do, so you do you
I just rolled my eyes so hard I saw my brain
You never realize how boring your life is until someone asks you what you do for fun
You know you’ve made it when your idols become your rivals
Be the type of person you want to meet
Just two friends having a good time
Guess who I just met?
Best. Day. EVER!
What just happened?
Go BIG or go home
Treat yourself like a king and you’ll attract your queen
This is GOLD
This is it!
Express gratitude. Regret nothing.

Be kind. Be love.
Follow your heart in everything you do
Don’t live a life regretting the things you didn’t do. Go do things!
All I could ever want is right in front of me
Don’t wait for the storm to pass, go out there and dance in the rain
